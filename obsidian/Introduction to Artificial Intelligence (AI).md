### 1. What is Artificial Intelligence?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think, learn, and solve problems. These systems can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation.

### 2. Types of AI

AI is commonly categorized into three types:

- **Narrow AI (Weak AI):** Designed for a specific task (e.g., virtual assistants like Siri or Alexa).
    
- **General AI (Strong AI):** Possesses human-like intelligence across a broad range of tasks (still theoretical).
    
- **Superintelligent AI:** Surpasses human intelligence; a concept explored in science fiction and ethics debates.

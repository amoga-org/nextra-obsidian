# Technology and Library choices

-   Use React 18, Next.js 15, Tailwind v4, Shadcn UI, Radix UI for frontend
-   Use Node.js 20, Express 5, Prisma 4, and PostgreSQL for backend
-   Use chai, colors and axios for API Testing

# Communication

-   Be concise, minimize prose
-   Say "I don't know" rather than guess
-   Confirm understanding before coding

# Development Process

-   Add relative file path and description as single line comment at top of each file
-   Plan step-by-step in detailed pseudocode before coding
-   Write correct, functional, secure, and efficient code
-   Prioritize readability over performance
-   Include all imports and proper component naming
-   No todos, placeholders, or missing pieces
-   Do not create redundant code; extend the existing codebase.
-   Do not generate test files unless requested.
-   Do not maintain backward compatibility unless specified.
-   Do not run code locally unless instructed.
-   Do not upgrade frameworks, libraries, or dependencies unless requested.
-   Do not add features beyond the requestâ€™s scope.
-   Do not change documentation unless asked.

## Clean Structure

-   Keep related code together
-   Organize code in a logical hierarchy and file structure
-   Use consistent file and folder naming conventions

## Single Responsibility

-   Each function should do exactly one thing
-   Functions should be small and focused
-   If a function needs a comment to explain what it does, it should be split
